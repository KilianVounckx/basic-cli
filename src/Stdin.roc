## > This task will block the program from continuing until `stdin` receives a newline character
## (e.g. because the user pressed Enter in the terminal), so using it can result in the appearance of the
## programming having gotten stuck. It's often helpful to print a prompt first, so
## the user knows it's necessary to enter something before the program will continue.
